<p>Here I keep my projects, ideas and exercises in several programming languages, I use some FrameWorks and libraries that help me in the execution of the Softwares.</p>

<p>I am in the process of professional and personal growth, always looking for new ideas and methodologies, I try to study every day.</p>
