### Hello, welcome to my profile.
Here I keep my projects, ideas and exercises in several programming languages, I use some FrameWorks and libraries that help me in the execution of the Softwares.

I am in the process of professional and personal growth, always looking for new ideas and methodologies, I try to study every day, but here among us, a self-respecting Dev, is in eternal learning.ðŸ‘‹
